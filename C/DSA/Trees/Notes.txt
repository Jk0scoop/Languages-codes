-->Terminology
1) Root - Top most Node
2) Parent - Node which connects to the child
3) Child - Node which is connected by prev node is called child node
4) Leaf/External Node - Node with No children
5) Internal Node - Node with atleast One child
6) Depth - Number of edges from root to node is called Depth
7) Height - Number of edges from root to the deepest Leaf is called Height
8) Siblings - Child Nodes having same Parent are Siblings of each other
9) Ancestors - Nodes above perticular node are Ancestors of that node
10) descendants - Nodes below perticular node are descendants of that node
11) Degree - Number of children of a node is called Degree of that node
12) Level - A level is the number of parent nodes corresponding to a given a node of the tree /  It is basically the number of ancestors from that node until the root node -- Root node level 0.


======> NONE LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE <======


-----> BINARY TREE - tree which has atmost 2 children for all the Nodes
--> Degree Allowed - 0,1,2.
--> tree is made up of nodes and edges
--> N nodes => N-1 edges
--> Degree of a tree is the highest Degree of a node among all the nodes present in the tree

----> Types of BINARY TREE
1) Full/Strict Binary tree - all nodes have either 0 or 2 children
2) Perfect Binary tree - all Internal Nodes have exactly 2 nodes + all Leaf nodes are on same Level
3) Complete Binary tree - all levels are Completely filled except possible last level + last level must have its child as left as possible
4) Degenerate tree - Parent node has exactly 1 child at either side
5) Skewed tree - left/right Skewed - all child node of Degenerate tree are at left/right side
